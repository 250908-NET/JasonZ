    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>About Me (again)</h2>
    <p>
      It's me, a person (allegedly). I enjoy long walks along the beach (of a
      lake in Factorio), and watching the sunset (in Minecraft). I have nothing
      else to say but this is supposed to be a paragraph, so I'll just say that
      we're no strangers to love. You know the rules, and so do I. A full
      commitment's what I'm thinkin' of. You wouldn't get this from any other
      guy.
    </p>
